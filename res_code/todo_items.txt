TODO 06.08.24:
1. Feedback the model , outputs, labels, predictions to ui and do plotting.
And if any changes feedback to the model.
2. Why is val accuracy messed up?
3. Same for other plots and add interactivity
4. Fix cluster movement in scatter plot
5. Adapt for other classes — test, to fix also
6. Add comments
7. Fix the samples to plot - 100 random at beginning and then track the same samples throughout.(balanced between classes) ——- IMP
8. Calculate cluster center with the plotted points. ——- IMP
9. Fix radar plot like parallel - one sample goes through all features
10. Fix parallel co ordinates dimensions axis plot
11. Plot does not change with refresh
12. Learning rate and batch size in cmd line arguments
13. Debug the training.py - why 2356? Print shape of inputs and labels
14. Add other loss
