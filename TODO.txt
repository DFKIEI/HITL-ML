TODO 06.08.24:
2. Why is val accuracy messed up?
5. Adapt for other classes — test, to fix also
7. Fix the samples to plot - 100 random at beginning and then track the same samples throughout.(balanced between classes) ——- IMP
8. Calculate cluster center with the plotted points. ——- IMP
9. Fix radar plot like parallel - one sample goes through all features -- done
10. Fix parallel co ordinates dimensions axis plot -- done
11. Plot does not change with refresh -- done
12. Learning rate and batch size in cmd line arguments
13. Debug the training.py - why 2356? Print shape of inputs and labels
14. Add other loss
15. Fix plot interactivity(cluster movement) - IMP
16. Improve performance of plotting - PCA and TSNE approach
